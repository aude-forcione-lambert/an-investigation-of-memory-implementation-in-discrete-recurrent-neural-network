# An Investigation of Memory Implementation in Discrete Recurrent Neural Networks

This is an interactive support made available as an addition to my summer intership report. My internship was completed in august 2018 at the Faculty of Arts and Sciences of the University of Montreal, Canada.

All images used in the report can be viewed as interactive 3d plots when running "analysis.ipynb" on your local machine. You'll find the entire report under the name "Internship_report.pdf", as well as a scientific poster based on my internship under the name "poster.pdf" (in french). The entirety of the code developped during the instership is available in the "whole_code" folder.
